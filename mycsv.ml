# Tool for parsing csv

Note that a record must end in a return. A CSV file is a sequence of records. Thus, for us, the last character in the file must be a return char. (As an exceptional case, there could be no records, ie the file is empty; in this case, a bug in the file reading code will add a return character probably.)

## Basic types

Type `ty_csv_params` allows you to parameterize on:

  * field separator
  * output field separator (not used in parsing)
  * double quote character
  * record separator (newline)

These can be strings (not characters). There is nothing in the following that prevents these being arbitrary parsers (but we keep them strings for now; we obviously would need string versions for output e.g. for `dquote^dquote`). The parameters are completely arbitrary. For example, they could all be the same character (but presumably any non-trivial csv file would then be very ambiguous).

type ty_csv_params = { sep:string; outsep:string; dquote:string; newline:string }

type ty_width = None1 | Some1 of int | Trim1 | Max1 | MaxNoQuote1
